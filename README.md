# Consuming Poloniex Webscocket API

This is an unfinished that supposed to consume Poloniex API.

## Running

Simple run `docker-compose up` and the page will be shown on localhost:8888

## Disclaimer
I know that the application is only started but was what I could develop in this short time. I, wrongly, started the application in PHP and found that it was very difficult to consume websocket with it. Then I studied Docker to meet the challenge requirement. There is nothing beautiful in the program but I would give it anyway to demonstrate my interest in continuing the process. I suggest you look at my github activity that will make my experience with the web clear. Thank you!
